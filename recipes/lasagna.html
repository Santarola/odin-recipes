    <p>Lasagna also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, 
        possibly one of the oldest types, 
        made of very wide, flat sheets. 
        Either term can also refer to an 
        Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna 
        alternating with fillings such as ragù 
        (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, 
        cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, 
        and parmesan), and seasonings and spices.</p>
    <p>Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other 
        ingredients and then baked in an oven. 
        The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving 
        square or rectangular portions.</p>
